It was then They told her they saw spots on her pancreas and liver. Since then she has been at home; Incredibly tired, waiting for biopsy, an official diagnosis,  and a treatment plan. This past Sunday she went back to the ER with worsened symptoms that were unmanageable at home. Since then we’ve been told it is stage 4 pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to multiple organs, and it’s a matter of days. \\n\\nMy bridesmaids were so kind to take the lead and call all of our vendors on my behalf. Our officiant offered to be there at any time to do a legal ceremony. I feel overwhelmed with love and care from our community around us, but also feel such a huge sadness. My mom was so happy and excited to learn we had gotten engaged, and was even more excited to help plan a wedding and be there. I had tried prompting the discussion last month around cancelling and she wouldn’t have it. Unfortunately now with the timing we just couldn’t bear to go through with the full wedding. Our vendors have us all down as rescheduled. I don’t know if I ever want the big wedding now at all. I can’t even think about it.</td>\n",

I explained to her it’s a faux pas and why her aunt was rightfully upset. Because of this conversation I’m confident that she knew to not wear white to my wedding. Also, I directly asked her to please not wear white to my bridal shower. She acted shocked like she’d never consider it and pretended to not remember telling me what happened with her aunt’s wedding, lying and saying she wore yellow so that never happened. It did, her own social media posts and the aunt’s professional photos she’s included in show it’s a white dress. She has a history of lying so I brushed it off. She acted shocked bc “she would never wear white to a bridal shower!”\\n\\nThen she shows up to my wedding wearing a floor length white dress. Her fiance is in the wedding party so she took a lot of photos with him dressed up as groomsman and posted them online wearing her floor length white dress. She didn’t bother mentioning it was our wedding or mentioning us at all.\\n\\nI’ve told her to not wear white to my wedding bc I knew she’d try to do something to bother me, and I was right.\\n\\nI’m frustrated and considering not posting the photos I got with her during the reception now.\\n\\nHer wedding is coming up in the future and I’m sure she’ll complain to me when people wear white dresses. BRB picking a non white dress for her wedding bc I’m the bigger person lol\\n\\n*EDIT: She’s not my friend, she’s my husband’s best friend’s fiancée. That was wordy so I just said friend LOL Her fiancé was the best man which is why she got a wedding invite out of obligation.\\n\\nThank you so much for giving suggestions, I’ve decided to NOT post any photos of her from the wedding when I receive them from photographer, and I’ll edit/crop her out of photos I do want to post. I didn’t expect this to get so much attention, thank you for taking the time to reply.</td>\n",

Would have love to have kept it a surprise for the wedding night but I’m feeling a lot better now that he knows its value a lot more.\\n\\n————————\\n\\nI’m not sure if this kind of question is allowed but I’m wondering how much people have spent on their lingerie for the wedding? (Please put what currency)\\n\\nI went shopping yesterday and unexpectedly found the lingerie I will be wearing on my wedding night. I bought it at a more boujee boutique.\\nI own very little lingerie (one item) and two nice bras.\\n\\nI ended up buying a fair few things and spent quite a bit of money and after my fiancé found out how much I spent, he was quite upset and he said he’s struggling with the amount I spent on it. I spent my own money on it and I told him this but he’s worried I won’t have money for other things leading up to the wedding.\\n\\nI’m now feeling super insecure and worried if I made a mistake. I’ve never had such nice lingerie before and I thought if there’s anytime to do it, it would be for my wedding night.\\n\\nI bought 4 items and it came to $550AUD ($350USD). I bought a bra, suspenders, a thong and a bustier.

       "      <td>Hi wedding planning fam! Exciting news, I got an email from my bridal shop saying my dress has arrived! But, they also said \"we'll show you the dress for inspection, but in order to keep it pristine, you will not be trying on your dress in store.\"\\n\\nThis seems super odd to me -- and after hearing some fit horror stories from my friends and on here, I'm really hesitant to take it home without trying it on first. \\n\\nMy question is -- is this normal policy? What should I do? \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for all your advice! this is Lovely Bride — not a hole in the wall place! I’ll be calling tomorrow and telling them I don’t feel comfortable leaving without trying it on first.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE: They are letting me try on! Response: “We usually don't do in-store try-ons when a bride picks up her gown, just to ensure it doesn't get dirty and because the fit wont be 100% until after tailoring! However, we would be happy to accomadate a quick 15 min try on.” I’m happy with this response and will be trying on when I pick it up.</td>\n",

Then went home later that day and made the bad choice of Googling my dress...... which was how I learned that I could've saved myself at least $840 if I had ordered my same, identical dress online. These sites were brick-and-mortar/physical stores around the U.S. that have an online presence.\\n\\nI'm still trying to get over this slight regret and to stop beating myself up for having said yes to the dress on the spot (it'd been the 4th store I'd visited). I wanted to just put this here in case future brides get to save some money that I didn't! I totally get that buying it in store is definitely going to be more expensive than buying it online, but did not expect such a huge difference.\\n\\nWhat added salt to the wound was that one of the online bridal stores was even having a trunk show 10% discount for that specific designer, which meant I could've saved over $1,000....\\n\\nYou live and you learn... hopefully this helps someone out there.</td>\n",

Instead we will be getting legally married today, Aug 23rd in my mothers hospital room as we’ve been informed she has only days to live. \\n\\n35 days ago my mom went to the ER in pain and discomfort. It was then They told her they saw spots on her pancreas and liver. Since then she has been at home; Incredibly tired, waiting for biopsy, an official diagnosis,  and a treatment plan. This past Sunday she went back to the ER with worsened symptoms that were unmanageable at home. Since then we’ve been told it is stage 4 pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to multiple organs, and it’s a matter of days. \\n\\nMy bridesmaids were so kind to take the lead and call all of our vendors on my behalf. Our officiant offered to be there at any time to do a legal ceremony. I feel overwhelmed with love and care from our community around us, but also feel such a huge sadness. My mom was so happy and excited to learn we had gotten engaged, and was even more excited to help plan a wedding and be there. I had tried prompting the discussion last month around cancelling and she wouldn’t have it. Unfortunately now with the timing we just couldn’t bear to go through with the full wedding. Our vendors have us all down as rescheduled. I don’t know if I ever want the big wedding now at all. I can’t even think about it.   \n",

A well-meaning guest purchased one but our entire registry has already been purchased and we had switched over to honeymoon funds. The guest said they received an email today prompting them to purchase it. Now we have a gift card to use only on The Knot. \\n\\nThe Knot is refusing to acknowledge that adding things to our registry without permission isn’t cool. \\n\\nSo long story long, go remove that egift card from your registry if you don’t want it!\\n\\nETA: If it appears on your registry, take a screenshot and let The Knot know this isn't cool or okay.\\n\\nUpdate: after some back and forth over Twitter, The Knot has refunded our guest (awkward, but hooray).   \n",

       "4   Rant:\\nMy friend wore white to her aunt’s wedding in the past and complained to me when her aunt got upset. I explained to her it’s a faux pas and why her aunt was rightfully upset. Because of this conversation I’m confident that she knew to not wear white to my wedding. Also, I directly asked her to please not wear white to my bridal shower. She acted shocked like she’d never consider it and pretended to not remember telling me what happened with her aunt’s wedding, lying and saying she wore yellow so that never happened. It did, her own social media posts and the aunt’s professional photos she’s included in show it’s a white dress. She has a history of lying so I brushed it off. She acted shocked bc “she would never wear white to a bridal shower!”\\n\\nThen she shows up to my wedding wearing a floor length white dress. Her fiance is in the wedding party so she took a lot of photos with him dressed up as groomsman and posted them online wearing her floor length white dress. She didn’t bother mentioning it was our wedding or mentioning us at all.\\n\\nI’ve told her to not wear white to my wedding bc I knew she’d try to do something to bother me, and I was right.\\n\\nI’m frustrated and considering not posting the photos I got with her during the reception now.\\n\\nHer wedding is coming up in the future and I’m sure she’ll complain to me when people wear white dresses. BRB picking a non white dress for her wedding bc I’m the bigger person lol\\n\\n*EDIT: She’s not my friend, she’s my husband’s best friend’s fiancée. That was wordy so I just said friend LOL Her fiancé was the best man which is why she got a wedding invite out of obligation.\\n\\nThank you so much for giving suggestions, I’ve decided to NOT post any photos of her from the wedding when I receive them from photographer, and I’ll edit/crop her out of photos I do want to post.

To my fiancé as well and did end up caving and showing him what I bought. He loved what I bought and now understands why it cost so much. Would have love to have kept it a surprise for the wedding night but I’m feeling a lot better now that he knows its value a lot more.\\n\\n————————\\n\\nI’m not sure if this kind of question is allowed but I’m wondering how much people have spent on their lingerie for the wedding? (Please put what currency)\\n\\nI went shopping yesterday and unexpectedly found the lingerie I will be wearing on my wedding night. I bought it at a more boujee boutique.\\nI own very little lingerie (one item) and two nice bras.\\n\\nI ended up buying a fair few things and spent quite a bit of money and after my fiancé found out how much I spent, he was quite upset and he said he’s struggling with the amount I spent on it. I spent my own money on it and I told him this but he’s worried I won’t have money for other things leading up to the wedding.\\n\\nI’m now feeling super insecure and worried if I made a mistake. I’ve never had such nice lingerie before and I thought if there’s anytime to do it, it would be for my wedding night.\\n\\nI bought 4 items and it came to $550AUD ($350USD). I bought a bra, suspenders, a thong and a bustier. They are all gorgeous and covered in mesh with lace.\\n\\n\\nI feel so stupid for spending so much money on just clothes and wondering if I should return them (can’t return the thing because I tried it on)\\n\\nWould really like some reassurance that I didn’t fuck up😣   \n",

Exciting news, I got an email from my bridal shop saying my dress has arrived! But, they also said \"we'll show you the dress for inspection, but in order to keep it pristine, you will not be trying on your dress in store.\"\\n\\nThis seems super odd to me -- and after hearing some fit horror stories from my friends and on here, I'm really hesitant to take it home without trying it on first. \\n\\nMy question is -- is this normal policy? What should I do? \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for all your advice! this is Lovely Bride — not a hole in the wall place! I’ll be calling tomorrow and telling them I don’t feel comfortable leaving without trying it on first.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE: They are letting me try on! Response: “We usually don't do in-store try-ons when a bride picks up her gown, just to ensure it doesn't get dirty and because the fit wont be 100% until after tailoring! However, we would be happy to accomadate a quick 15 min try on.” I’m happy with this response and will be trying on when I pick it up.   \n",

Then went home later that day and made the bad choice of Googling my dress...... which was how I learned that I could've saved myself at least $840 if I had ordered my same, identical dress online. These sites were brick-and-mortar/physical stores around the U.S. that have an online presence.\\n\\nI'm still trying to get over this slight regret and to stop beating myself up for having said yes to the dress on the spot (it'd been the 4th store I'd visited). I wanted to just put this here in case future brides get to save some money that I didn't! I totally get that buying it in store is definitely going to be more expensive than buying it online, but did not expect such a huge difference.\\n\\nWhat added salt to the wound was that one of the online bridal stores was even having a trunk show 10% discount for that specific designer, which meant I could've saved over $1,000....\\n\\nYou live and you learn... hopefully this helps someone out there.   \n",

My coworker and I were talking about weddings and she mentioned regretting spending $2000 on her dress. I’m actually feeling very similarly to her. I have a couple of dresses I like, but I’m leaning towards the less expensive one because I don’t want to spend $1300 on something I’ll wear once. I feel like the $ can go towards getting a shuttle for guests or some extra flowers. \\n\\nAnyone have strong opinions? I’m genuinely curious!   \n",
