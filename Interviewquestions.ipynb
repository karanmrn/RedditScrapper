       "      <td>I applied for clinical support specialist job here in Europe. The medical device company is based in UK but moving operations to our country. I applied for the job which aligns with my skills, there were no salary range or benefits at all in the job description. Got an e-mail for a call. Set up the meeting. And apparently that zoom call is already an interview? I was caught off guard that I was applying for a different company and he is just the recruiter group.  He explained the company, the job. And then he asked my experience and how it aligns with the job. And then he asked If I know anything about the company, I told him none. And then I asked him what’s the salary. And he stopped me there, and ended the interview.\\n\\nBackground: I already get paid for €60-€65k on my current job. And applying for a support specialist will be a downgrade in salary, i see it rangers €40-45k, that’s why I wanted to know first what’s the salary before investing my time for a thorough interview. \\n\\nIs this how people conduct interviews now? Last interview I had was 2016.</td>\n",

I checked out her profile and CV and she was brilliant on paper, so I invited her for an interview.\\n\\nShe absolutely crushed the interview and I just prepared her offer letter. During the interview she said that she directly reached out to me because her application has been rejected a couple of times already when submitting it through our website and she didn't understand why.\\n\\nI am absolutely livid right now, I just lodged a complaint with recruitment on this matter. What the hell?!?!?!?! How many brilliant and qualified people do hiring managers never get to see because recruitment just straight out reject their CVs and hiring managers don't even get a chance to judge them?!?!?!   \n",

They asked to do a 4th interview and then ended up rejecting me before I did the interview, 4 hours after asking me to schedule.

       "95  Basically applied for a seasonal job via indeed( job was only on indeed and not on company website), got a invite for phone screen next day not even 24 hours. Did phone screen despite interviewer being 45 minutes late and me not picking up when they actually did call. I get another call and decide what the hell ill go for it. Was told in person interviews are next week ( its now next week) no call as of yet although I do expect a last minute call to scramble when yet another candidate drops. Job is  on company website.  As I was told previous person left role ( its a term role which expires) Previous candidate had benefits, new role does not and is basically -3 months from whatever the other person did so less time for new candidate. Role was supposed to start in August, looks like itll end up being September since its now august 21.\\n\\nWhat in the actual fuck is going on with the state of hiring right now. Basically im gathering they are trying to play catch up to fill the role as quick as possible and totally behind the timeline they set for themselves. SO basically I get less because they fucked up, and basically found out they have terrible time management skills, terrible foresight , potential terrible environment since someone did leave this role in 2 months of starting.\\n\\nRealistically I don't give a fuck if they hire me, I really don't I have other options but want to try different stuff and especially leave my current job   \n",

And the interview was for a shitty sales position titled “Business Developer”, figured I’d do it anyways to get interview practice, and didn’t even hear back from them either. I’m lucky enough that I still have my part time retail job to save money while I still live with my parents, but I can feel the pressure. Being a pathetic disappointment to my parents asking me every single day “hear from any more jobs?” with that look that you can tell they’ve lost hope in you. Also have just completely gotten rid of any social life I’ve had, as it feels like the only thing anyone wants to talk about is their new job, and saying you still work retail is fucking embarassing. Why did I waste 4 years on a useless degree, and waste everyone’s time, like wtf. Just ranting because I’m at my wits end and I figure this is better than just staring at the wall in rage for half an hour.   \n",

Originally I was supposed to find myself an internship and I had to give up because all of the positions closed and no one wanted me. So I decided to do the next best option of just getting any general job, and that didn't work out either. I can't even find a temp agency job, because there's almost nothing near where I live. Worst of all, my bank account has been depleting ever since, and I can't even make important purchases anymore.\\n\\nI'm just don't know what to do anymore, I just feel like crying and cursing out the world, or maybe I deserve to be broke and go nowhere in life.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**EDIT:** Just a day after I made this post, a job I applied to weeks/a month ago called me back and I got hired on the spot. Though if I'm going to be honest, I highly doubt it will last long due to various circumstances that I don't feel like explaining at the moment, but my prayers have sort of been answered I guess.

The medical device company is based in UK but moving operations to our country. I applied for the job which aligns with my skills, there were no salary range or benefits at all in the job description. Got an e-mail for a call. Set up the meeting. And apparently that zoom call is already an interview? I was caught off guard that I was applying for a different company and he is just the recruiter group.  He explained the company, the job. And then he asked my experience and how it aligns with the job. And then he asked If I know anything about the company, I told him none. And then I asked him what’s the salary. And he stopped me there, and ended the interview.\\n\\nBackground: I already get paid for €60-€65k on my current job. And applying for a support specialist will be a downgrade in salary, i see it rangers €40-45k, that’s why I wanted to know first what’s the salary before investing my time for a thorough interview. \\n\\nIs this how people conduct interviews now? Last interview I had was 2016.   \n",

       "21  Just saying…I stated more than explicitly in my last open position that I would accept “anyone interested in the job as a train-on-the-job” entry level. No one below a bachelor student even applied. If I say “we will Train you”, guess what. We WILL train you on the job. That’s why it’s entry level! I fought for that description tooth and nails. Nothing. \\nHonestly next time I won’t even bother with that part and hope someone who I can train will apply for an entry level job.\\n\\nEdit: just apply. At least with me you would get a chance. Of course I can’t talk for everyone, but there are actual entry level jobs out there. I was given a great opportunity years ago. And I want to be the same leader that one was for me in the. Past. Giving people a chance to develop and being open for people who still search for the way to go\n",
